# ZenBot Development Rules and Guidelines

## Project Structure and Organization

### Domain Structure and Routing
See `DOMAINS.md` for detailed information about:
- Development and production domain setup
- Project structure for multi-domain support
- Middleware configuration
- Cloudflare Pages deployment
- Environment variable configuration

### Code Organization
1. All new features should follow the app directory structure outlined in `DOMAINS.md`
2. Keep domain-specific code within its respective directory (hub/, run/)
3. Shared components should be placed in the components directory
4. Use appropriate layouts for each domain section

### Development Guidelines
1. Always run the development server using `npm run dev`
2. Test all features across all domain paths during development
3. Ensure middleware handles routing correctly in both development and production
4. Keep environment variables up to date as specified in `DOMAINS.md`

### Deployment Rules
1. All deployments must be done through Cloudflare Pages
2. Verify custom domain configuration before deployment
3. Test all domain routes after deployment
4. Ensure environment variables are properly set in Cloudflare
5. Monitor domain health after deployment

### Code Quality
1. Follow TypeScript best practices
2. Use proper type definitions
3. Keep components modular and reusable
4. Write clear and concise documentation
5. Follow the established project structure
