# Architecture Decisions

This document tracks key architectural decisions made during the development of ZenBot and the reasoning behind them.

## Framework and Technology Choices

| Decision | Reason |
|----------|---------|
| Next.js 14 with React 18 | - Latest stable version with improved performance<br>- App Router for better file-based routing<br>- Server Components for optimal performance<br>- Server Actions for form handling<br>- Improved image optimization<br>- Built-in TypeScript support<br>- Enhanced data fetching capabilities |
| Supabase as backend platform | - Provides a complete backend solution with built-in authentication<br>- PostgreSQL database with real-time capabilities<br>- Row Level Security for fine-grained access control<br>- Built-in API generation saves development time<br>- Storage system suitable for document management<br>- Easy integration with Next.js |
| shadcn/ui as component library | - Modern, accessible components built on Radix UI<br>- Simple installation via `npx shadcn@latest init`<br>- Components installed directly into project for maximum customization<br>- Highly customizable with Tailwind CSS<br>- Growing adoption in AI tools and platforms<br>- Excellent TypeScript support<br>- Active community and frequent updates |
| next-mdx-remote for MDX processing | - Dynamic MDX rendering without build step<br>- Supports storing MDX in databases<br>- Flexible content loading from any source<br>- Built-in security features<br>- Efficient server-side rendering<br>- Compatible with Next.js App Router |
| Cloudflare Pages for deployment | - Edge runtime for optimal global performance<br>- Seamless integration with Next.js<br>- Automatic builds and deployments<br>- Zero-configuration SSL<br>- Automatic CI/CD pipeline<br>- Global CDN distribution |

## Version Requirements
- Node.js >= 18.17
- Next.js 14.x (Note: Next.js 15 is available, plan to upgrade when stable)
- React 18.x (Note: React 19 RC is available, plan to upgrade when stable)
- TypeScript 5.x
- Tailwind CSS 3.x
- @cloudflare/next-on-pages >= 1.8.5

## Cloudflare Pages Requirements
1. Runtime Compatibility:
   - All server-side components must use Edge Runtime
   - Server components include:
     - App Router layouts
     - API routes
     - Middleware
     - Server actions

2. Build Configuration:
   - Build command: `npx @cloudflare/next-on-pages`
   - Build output directory: `.vercel/output/static` (configured in wrangler.toml)
   - Node.js compatibility flags enabled

3. Environment Variables:
   - NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
   - NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
   - Additional secrets managed via Cloudflare dashboard

4. Required Files:
   - wrangler.toml for Cloudflare configuration
   - next.config.mjs with Edge Runtime setup
   - Updated package.json with Cloudflare build scripts

## Upgrade Planning
We acknowledge that both Next.js and React have Release Candidates available for their next major versions. Our strategy:
1. Start with stable versions (Next.js 14, React 18)
2. Monitor RC releases and their stability
3. Plan upgrade path once stable versions are released
4. Test upgrade impacts in a staging environment
5. Document any breaking changes and required modifications

## Deployment Strategy
1. Local Development:
   - `npm run dev` for standard Next.js development
   - `npm run preview` to test Cloudflare Pages locally

2. Production Deployment:
   - Automatic deployments via GitHub integration
   - Manual deployments via `npm run deploy`
   - Preview deployments for pull requests

3. Environment Management:
   - Development: Local environment
   - Preview: Pull request deployments
   - Production: Main branch deployments

## Future Decisions Pending
- State management approach
- Testing framework
